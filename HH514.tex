% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
  We analyze the physical conditions and chemical composition of the photoionized Herbig-Haro HH~514, located $0.025 \text{\ pc}$ southwest of $\theta^1$ Ori C in the Orion Nebula. We use high-spectral resolution spectroscopy from the UVES spectrograph at the \textit{Very Large Telescope} and IFU-spectra from MEGARA at the \textit{Gran Telescopio de Canarias} to spectrally and spatially isolate the spectrum of HH~514 from the main nebular emission. We observe two components of HH~514, the jet base and a knot, with $n_{\rm e}= (2.3 \pm 0.1) \times 10^5 \text{\,cm}^{-3}$ and $n_{\rm e}= (7 \pm 1) \times 10^4 \text{\,cm}^{-3}$, respectively, both with $T_{\rm e}\approx 9000 \text{ K}$. We show that the chemical composition of HH~514 is consistent with the values found in the Orion Nebula, except for Fe, Ni and S, which show higher abundances due to  destruction of dust grains after the passage of the shock front.
  HH~514 shows a greater degree of dust destruction than slower-moving Herbig--Haro shocks that we have studied in previous works.
% HH~514 shows a larger  propagation velocity --of about $\sim160\text{ km s}^{-1}$-- and a larger degree of dust grain destruction than other Herbig-Haro objects of the Orion Nebula we have studied in previous works.
The S enrichment by a factor of more than 2 reveals that the dust grains destroyed in the HH~514 flow were rich in sulfides and/or other S-bearing minerals, in contrast to what is found in other areas of the Orion Nebula. The formation of S reservoirs may be linked to the presence of planets in protoplanetary disks, which are capable of filtering large sulfide dust grains during the accretion of matter from the disk to the central star. %Given the origin of HH~514 in the proplyd 170-337, it is likely that the S-rich material comes from it.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Advances in astrophysical instrumentation in recent decades have allowed detailed observations of internal structures in Galactic star-forming regions. Among them, the observations of small-spatial scale structures in the Orion Nebula have been pioneering. Since the 1990s, with the first images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),
dozens of photoevaporating protoplanetary disks \citep[proplyds,][]{Odell1993}
have been discovered and analyzed in the nebula.
Proplyds generally have a compact semi-circular head
with an extended tail that points away from the ionizing source.
Their greatest concentration is in the central core of the Orion Nebula Cluster,
which contains the four high-mass Trapezium stars,
with \th1C{} (O7~Vp; \citealp{Sota:2011a}) being the most luminous member
and the dominant ionizing source for the nebula.
The Trapezium region is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:hst}
with an image that has been high-pass filtered to emphasize sub-arcsecond structures
(\(\SI{1}{arcsec} \approx \SI{0.002}{pc}\) for an assumed distance of \SI{388 \pm 5}{pc},
\citealp{Kounkel:2017a}).
High-mass stars and proplyds are labelled following the nomenclature
of \citet{Laques:1979a} for the 6 closest proplyds to \th1C{}
and the coordinate-based names of \citet{Odell:1994a} for the remaining.

In many of the proplyds in the surrounding areas of \th1C, gas outflows and jets have been observed. Several of them have been classified as Herbig-Haro objects (HHs),
some of which are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:hst}.
This is the case of HH~514, which originates in the proplyd 170-337 \citep[][]{Bally:1998a},
located \SI{12.61}{arcsec} from \th1C.
A redshifted microjet of size \SI{0.5}{arcsec} protrudes northwards from the proplyd
ionization front
(marked as ``jet base'' in Fig.~\ref{fig:hst})
and a short chain of redshifted knots
(marked as ``knot'' in Fig.~\ref{fig:hst})
are seen at a distance of \SI{\approx 4}{arcsec}
along the same axis
\citep{bally00, odellyhenney08}.
Proper motion and spectroscopic measurements yield
radial and tangential velocities of
$v_{r} \sim 153.4 \pm 0.5  \text{ km s}^{-1}$ (this work)
and $ v_{t} \approx 48 \text{ km s}^{-1}$ .
A blueshifted counterflow is also detected at the base of the jet,
but it is much weaker.
This is unusual for HH flows in Orion,
which tend to be predominantly blueshifted \citep[][]{Henney:2007b}.
A very faint knot to the S of the proplyd may be associated with this counterjet.

HH~514 is particularly bright in the emission of [Fe\thinspace III] lines, showing also intense lines of  [Fe\thinspace II], [Ni\thinspace II] and [Ni\thinspace III]. In addition, its proximity to $\theta^1$ Ori C and its large propagation velocity make it an excellent laboratory to explore the phenomenon of destruction of dust grains by analyzing the abundances of Fe and Ni in the gas.
Many HH objects have relatively large gaseous abundances of Fe and Ni,
whereas in the rest of the Orion Nebula these abundances are much smaller \citep[][]{mendez2021-2}.

In this paper, the third in a series dedicated to photoionized HH objects in the Orion Nebula, we analyze by the first time, the physical conditions, the chemical composition and the kinematics of HH~514. We use high-resolution spectroscopy from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) \citep[][]{Dodorico00} of the Very Large Telescope and IFU spectra from MEGARA \citep{gildepaz+18} at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Given the high spectral and spatial resolution of our observations, we have analyzed two velocity components associated with two areas of HH~514: the jet base and a northern knot, completely separated from the emission of the Orion Nebula. Our analysis focuses mainly on estimating the total abundances of Fe and Ni, which seems to be mainly in gaseous phase due to the strong degree of destruction of dust grains in the shock front. We also report an overabundance of S and discuss its possible origin.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:data} we describe the observations and the data reduction process. In Sec.~\ref{sec:physical_cond} we derive the physical conditions of each kinematic component. In Sec.~\ref{sec:ionic_total_abundances} we derive the ionic and total abundances. In Sec.~\ref{sec:disc} we discuss our results, focusing on the observed overabundance of S, the total abundances of Fe and Ni and the kinematic properties of HH~514. In Sec.~\ref{sec:summary_and_conclusions} we summarize our main conclusions. Finally in the Appendix~\ref{sec:apendix_A} we add tables of data
and figures as supporting material.

\section{Observations and data reduction}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{High spectral resolution observations}
\label{sec:data_uves}

The observations were taken during the nights of 29 and 30 October, 2013, under clear conditions using the UT2 (Kueyen) of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Cerro Paranal, Chile, with the Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrograph \citep[UVES;][]{Dodorico00}. The central coordinates of the 10 arcsec slit are: RA(J2000)=05$^h$35$^m$16$^s$.95, DEC(J2000)=$-$05$^{\circ}$23$'$33.72$''$ oriented along the north-south spatial axis as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hst}. The slit width of 1\arcsec provides an effective spectral resolution of $\lambda/\Delta \lambda \approx 6.5 \text{ km s}^{-1}$ in the spectral range between 3100 and 10400 \AA. Analogously to the observations described in the articles on HH~529~II-III and HH~204 \citep[][hereinafter Paper~I and Paper~II, respectively]{mendez2021,mendez2021-2}, three exposures of 150s each of the star GD71 \citep{Moehler14a, Moehler14b} were taken during the same night under similar conditions to achieve the flux calibration of the science data. The configuration of the instrument and the data reduction procedure are described in detail in Paper~I while the main settings of the observations of HH~514 are shown in Table~\ref{tab:obs_set}. We define three spatial cuts along the observed slit as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cuts}, covering the main high-velocity components,
which are redshifted by about $150\text{ km s}^{-1}$ from the nebular component.
We name the southernmost high-velocity component (within Cut~1) as the jet and the one located in the central cut as the knot. The nebular emission of Cut~1 also contains the emission of the proplyd 170-337. The complete analysis of the physical conditions and chemical composition of this proplyd will be the subject of a future work (M\'endez-Delgado et al., in prep). In this work we will only mention some results on the abundance of S in 170-337 in Sec.~\ref{subsec:real_overabundance}, which is relevant for our analysis of HH~514. Panel (b) of Fig.~\ref{fig:cuts} shows several components at intermediate redshifted velocities between that of the nebula and HH~514, which are seen mainly in lines of highly ionized ions such as [O\thinspace III] or [Ne\thinspace III]. Unfortunately, their emission is very weak in most spectral lines, so the determination of physical conditions and chemical abundances for those velocity components is not reliable with the present data and they are not studied further here.
They may be associated with the HH~518 flow from the proplyd 159-350
(see Figure~\ref{fig:hst}).
In order to increase the contrast of the HH~514 emission, which is rather weak compared to the main nebular background emission, we subtract Cut~3, which contains only background nebular emission, from Cut~1 and Cut~2, re-scaling its emission by the number of pixels of each cut. In addition to increasing the contrast of the HH~514 emission, this subtraction procedure permits us to remove sky and ghost contamination from the spectra of the HH object. We estimate the flux of the emission lines, their FWHM and their central wavelength by gaussian fittings using the SPLOT task of IRAF\footnote{IRAF is distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation} \citep{Tody93} as is described in detail in Paper~I. We achieve the reddening correction by using the same procedure described in Paper~I and Paper~II, using the extinction curve from \citet{Blagrave07}. The resulting values of $\text{c}(\text{H}\beta)$, are presented in Table~\ref{tab:c_extin}. In Table~\ref{tab:sample_spectra} we include the relevant information for some of the emission lines of the spectrum of the jet base, as an example of the tables of the complete spectra that are provided as online material.

\subsection{IFU observations}
\label{sec:data_megara}

Optical integral-field spectrograph observations of HH~514 were carried out on the night of 28 February 2022 under dark, photometric sky conditions and a seeing of $\sim$1.2 arcsec using MEGARA \citep{gildepaz+18} at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The low-resolution (LR) Volume-Phased Holographic (VPH) grism VPH675-LR was used; this grism covers the 6095--7300 \AA\ wavelength range  with a spectral dispersion of 0.287 \AA\ pix$^{-1}$ and an effective resolution of R$\sim$5900. Three 900 s exposures were taken in order to minimize the impact of cosmic-rays in the relatively large field of view of MEGARA (12$''$.5 $\times$ 11$''$.3). 
The MEGARA data were reduced using the {\it megaradrp} v0.11 pipeline \citep{pascual+19, pascual+20}. The pipeline uses several python-based recipes to perform bias substraction, fibre-tracing,  flat-field correction, wavelength calibration, and spectra extraction. Sky subtraction was avoided owing to the large size of the Orion nebula prevented to place any of the MEGARA sky bundles on a nebular emission-free zone of the sky. Flux calibration was also performed using the spectrophotometric standard star HR\,1544. The final product is a row-stacked spectrum that is converted into a datacube of 0$''$.2 square spaxel on spatial dimensions using the {\it megararss2cube} task of the {\it megara-tools} suite v0.1.1 \citep{gildepaz+20}.

\section{Physical Conditions}
\label{sec:physical_cond}

We use the version 1.1.13 of PyNeb \citep{Luridiana15} and the atomic data set shown in Tables 9 and 10 from Paper~II to derive the physical conditions of the different gas  components analyzed in this work. The adopted electron density, $n_{\rm e}$, in the nebular components is a weighted average\footnote{The weights were defined as the inverse of the square of the error associated to each density diagnostic.} of the resulting values from the CEL diagnostics
[O\thinspace II] $\lambda3726/\lambda3729$, [S\thinspace II] $\lambda6731/\lambda6716$, [Cl\thinspace III] $\lambda5538/\lambda5518$, [Fe\thinspace II] $\lambda9268/\lambda9052$, [Fe\thinspace III] $\lambda4658/\lambda4702$ and [Ar\thinspace IV]  $\lambda4740/\lambda4711$.  In addition, we apply the maximum-likelihood procedure described in Sec.~4.2 of Paper~I to derive the physical conditions based on the [Fe\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda $ 4658, 4702, 4734, 4881, 5011 and 5271 lines. As it was commented in Paper~I, with the adopted atomic data, [Fe\thinspace III] diagnostics are not adequately sensitive to density for values smaller than $10^{3} \text{ cm}^{-3}$, thus if a considerable part of the observed ionized gas has densities of the order or lower than that value (as it is expected in the nebular components), the resulting $n_{\rm e}$ may be biased to that of the densest zones along the line of sight. The value of $n_{\rm e}(\text{O\thinspace II})$ was derived with the available RLs of multiplet 1 and the results are highly consistent with the adopted average density.

In the plasma diagnostics of the jet base, there are two possible intersections of the temperature sensitive curve of [N\thinspace II] $\lambda5755/\lambda6584$ with the density sensitive ones, giving very different values of the electron temperature,  $T_{\rm e}$. One gives an extremely high density (larger than 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$) (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:plasma}) or an extremely high temperature (higher than 10$^{5}$ K at smaller densities than 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, beyond the scale of Fig.~\ref{fig:plasma}). The [Fe\thinspace III] $\lambda4658/\lambda4702$, [S\thinspace II] $\lambda$4069/$\lambda$4076 and [O\thinspace II] $\lambda$7319+20/$\lambda$7330+31 density diagnostics confirm the first case. In the two studied components of HH~514 we estimate the convergence of $n_{\rm e}-T_{\rm e}$ by using the [Fe\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda$ 4658, 4702, 4734, 4881, 5011, 5271 CELs. The resulting density in the jet base of HH~514 is $10^{5.37} \text{ cm}^{-3}$. 

In the case of the northern knot of HH~514, the convergence shows a higher dispersion in $n_{\rm e}-T_{\rm e}$ which seems to be due to the mixture of two or more gas components with similar velocities and notably different physical and/or ionization conditions. As it is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spatial_dis}, the spatial distribution along the slit of the intensity of the  [Fe\thinspace III] $\lambda 4658$ line centred at a heliocentric velocity of $\sim 150 \text{ km s}^{-1}$ is double-peaked in the northern knot of HH~514, which shows that at least two different gas components moving at a similar velocity are integrated in this part of the HH object. However, the separation into two spatial components results in a very low signal-to-noise spectra. Thus, the physical conditions derived in the knot are expected to be more uncertain than those in the jet base.

Based on the adopted density in each component, we estimate $T_{\rm e}$ through various diagnostics shown in Table~\ref{tab:pc}. In the nebular components, we define $T_{\rm e} \text{ (low)}$ as the weighted average of $T_{\rm e} (\text{[N\thinspace II]})$, $T_{\rm e} (\text{[O\thinspace II]})$ and $T_{\rm e} (\text{[S\thinspace II]})$ while $T_{\rm e} \text{ (high)}$ is the weighted average of $T_{\rm e} (\text{[O\thinspace III]})$, $T_{\rm e} (\text{[S\thinspace III]})$ and $T_{\rm e} (\text{[Ar\thinspace III]})$. In both components of HH~514, the estimation of $T_{\rm e} \text{ (low)}$ is quite uncertain, given the low critical density of the diagnoses available for this ionization zone and the high density of these objects. Due to this, and considering the similarity between $T_{\rm e}(\text{[O\thinspace III]})$ in both velocity components, we will adopt the $T_{\rm e} \text{ (low)}$ determined for the jet base --the spectrum with the best signal to noise ratio-- as also representative for the knot.

%\cesar{No recuerdo por que se dice esto. Propongo quitar la frase que he marcado It is noticeable that, despite of the extremely high density of HH~514~I-II, the temperature is consistent with the expected values in photoionization equilibrium.} 
%\cesar{No veo clara la discusión que he marcado en rojo. Es una diferencia muy pequeña, yo lo quitaría, incluida la nota el pie. Te parece? There it seems to be a slightly underprediction of , which would be expected to be equal to or greater than $T_{\rm e}(\text{[O\thinspace III]})$ due to temperature stratification} \footnote{\cesar{Photons with energies close to the photoionization threshold of the elements are more easily absorbed since the photoionization absorption cross section values decrease as the energy of the photon increases \citep{osterbrock06}. This causes the less energetic photons (with energies greater than the ionization threshold) to be absorbed first than the more energetic ones, which generally implies that the areas with a lower degree of ionization of the nebula are hotter. Since the ionization potential of S$^{2+}$ is lower than that of O$^{2+}$, we would expect, at first approximation, $T_{\rm e}(\text{[S\thinspace III]})\geq T_{\rm e}(\text{[O\thinspace III]})$.}}. \cesar{This behaviour of $T_{\rm e}(\text{[S\thinspace III]})$ may have a common origin with an apparent overabundance of S$^{2+}$ in HH~514~I-II. This is gonna be discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:disc}.} \jorge{Estoy de acuerdo en quitarlo. A pesar de que en HH514-II parece significativo, no estamos del todo seguros y no aporta mucho}

\section{Ionic and Total Abundances}
\label{sec:ionic_total_abundances}

%\cesar{Eduardo, reescribe lo que he marcado en rojo, no lo veo claro ni en qué te basas para decirlo. In HH 514 I-II, we derive Fe$^{2+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ using $T_{\rm e} \text{ (high)}$ while in the nebular component we use $T_{\rm e} \text{ (low)}$ since for the high velocity components, $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([Fe\thinspace III])}$ suggest a better association of Fe$^{2+}$ with the physical conditions of the gas of high degree of ionization}.

We derive ionic abundances of N$^{+}$, O$^{+}$, S$^{+}$, Cl$^{+}$, Ca$^{+}$, Fe$^{+}$ and Ni$^{+}$ based on CELs and using $T_{\rm e} \text{ (low)}$. We derive the abundances of Cl$^{2+}$ and S$^{2+}$ using $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ and the ionic abundances of O$^{2+}$, Ne$^{2+}$, Cl$^{3+}$, Ar$^{2+}$, Ar$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ using $T_{\rm e} \text{ (high)}$. In the nebular components, we derive the abundance of Fe$^{2+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ using $T_{\rm e} \text{ (low)}$. However, in both components of HH~514, the derived $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([Fe\thinspace III])}$ indicate a lower temperature than $T_{\rm e} \text{ (low)}$. This can be related to the dust destruction process described in detail in Sec.~\ref{subsec:real_overabundance}, where the filtering and destruction of dust grains increase the relative abundance of metals, cooling the gas. Therefore, in HH~514 we derive the abundances of Fe$^{2+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ using $T_{\rm e} \text{ (high)}$. In the case of the abundance of Ca$^+$, we must take into account the possible coexistence of Ca$^+$ and H$^0$, due to its low ionization potential. Therefore, the derived Ca$^+$/H$^+$ may be an upper limit to the real abundance.

As discussed in Paper~II, some [Fe\thinspace II] and [Ni\thinspace II] lines can be produced mostly by continuum pumping instead of collisional excitation. We make sure that the estimation of the Fe$^+$ abundance is not affected by fluorescence by using lines of the lower  a$^4$F--a$^4$P levels  ($\lambda \lambda$ 7155, 8892, 9052, 9267) mostly populated by collisions \citep{Baldwin96}. In the case of Ni$^+$ the fluorescence effects may be larger, considering that the  levels involved in the transitions that give rise to the observed optical lines have the same multiplicity. However, if the density is high enough, collisional excitations may dominate the production of [Ni\thinspace II] lines. Following the same procedure described in equation 1 from Paper~II --based on the equation 8 from \citet{Bautista96}--, we estimate a critical density of $n_{\text{cf}}= 55860 \text{ cm}^{-3}$, from which collisions dominate over  fluorescence in the production of [Ni\thinspace II] $\lambda 7378$ line at the apparent distance of 12.61 arcsecs from $\theta^1$ Ori C. This implies that in both the jet base and the northern knot --regions with densities larger than $n_{\text{cf}}$--, we can directly calculate the abundance of Ni$^{+}$ based on the intensity of [Ni\thinspace II] $\lambda 7378$ line. However, this is not possible in the nebular components, where --due to the much lower density-- fluorescence should dominate.

In the UVES spectrum of the jet base of HH~514, we are able to estimate an upper limit for the abundance of Fe$^{3+}$ based on the noise level of the continuum at $\sim 6743.30$\AA, where we would expect the emission of [Fe\thinspace IV] $\lambda6740$. We carefully estimated this upper limit, taking into account that at 6742.91\AA~ there may be a relatively weak telluric emission line \citep[][]{Hanuschik03}. However, since Cut~3 was subtracted from Cut~1, --rescaling to the same number of pixels-- to increase the contrast between the nebular emission and the HH~514~jet base spectrum, any contamination by telluric lines has been eliminated. In this case we obtain an upper limit of 12+log(Fe$^{3+}$/H$^+$) $<$ 6.99.

To better constraint the flux of the [Fe\thinspace IV] $\lambda6740$ line in the jet base component of HH~514, we search into the MEGARA deep spectra cube (see Sect.~\ref{sec:data_megara}), analyzing the spatial area that comprises the proplyd 170-337 (which includes the emission of the jet base), subtracting the nebular emission from a surrounding area to optimize the contrast of the high-velocity emission -- as is indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:megara} -- as well as remove weak sky features. The resulting 1D-spectrum is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:megara_vs_UVES}, having a higher SNR than the UVES spectra, although with lower spectral resolution. This spectrum allowed us to restrict the upper limit the Fe$^{3+}$ abundance to   12+log(Fe$^{3+}$/H$^+$) $<$ 6.79.

In the nebular spectra, we estimate the He$^{+}$, C$^{2+}$, O$^{+}$, O$^{2+}$ and Ne$^{2+}$ abundances making use of RLs following the same procedure described in Paper~I. In the case of the two components of HH~514 analysed in this work, we can  only determine the abundances of He$^{+}$ from RLs. In this case, the adopted He$^{+}$ abundance is an average of the resulting values based on the available He\thinspace I singlet lines and triplet ones less affected by self-absorption effects (See Table D14 from Paper~I). The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ionic_abundances}.

To estimate the total abundances of C, N, Ne, S and Ar, we use the ionization correction factors (ICFs) from \citet{Amayo2021}. These ICFs, based on photoionization models of giant H~II regions, are consistent with the schemes shown in table~10 of Paper~I. However, they additionally provide the 1-$\sigma$ limits of their predictions, allowing the formal propagation of uncertainties associated to the ICFs. In our nebular spectra, the calculation of the total abundances of O, Cl and Fe did not require ICF and were estimated from the sum of their ionic abundances. In the case of Ar, Ar$^+$ is estimated to contribute only 1 or 2 per cent of the total Ar abundance, having a negligible impact. We estimate the total abundance of Ni as $\text{Fe/Ni}=\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Ni}^{2+}$ based on their similar depletion and ionization patterns \citep[][]{mendez2021-2}. In the case of the He abundance in the nebular components, we use the ICF of \citet{kunthsargent83}. Since we have a reliable determination of the abundance of O$^+$ and O$^{2+}$ both with CELs and RLs, we derive the total abundances of He, Ne and C using the degree of ionization estimated from the abundances of the two ionic species of O determined from RLs. 


In the case of the jet base of HH~514, we determine the total abundance of Fe as Fe/H = Fe$^{+}$/H$^{+}$+Fe$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$+Fe$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$, summing the estimated upper limit of 12+log(Fe$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$) = 6.79. At first approximation, the total abundance of Fe should be between $7.18 \pm 0.02$ and $7.33 \pm 0.02$, where the value of 12+log(Fe$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$) takes values between 0 and 6.79.  \citet{rodriguez05} provides two ICF(Fe) schemes, where the true Fe abundance should be between the limits predicted by both schemes, based on the observed O$^{+}$/O$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$/O$^{+}$ ratios. In our case, both ICFs match in the value of 7.50. Therefore, considering the observational uncertainties in the abundance of O$^{+}$, this suggest that the upper limit of the value of Fe$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$ should be close to its expected true value and therefore 12+log(Fe/H)$\approx 7.33 \pm 0.02$. 

It is remarkable that log(Ni$^{+}$/Fe$^{+}$) = $-1.20 \pm 0.16$, while log(Ni$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$) = $-1.30 \pm 0.07$, which confirms the conclusions of \citet{mendez2021-2} about the similar ionization and depletion patterns of Ni and Fe. Furthermore, this demonstrates that the effects of fluorescence on our Ni$^{+}$ abundance determination are negligible, since we would expect stronger continuum pumping effects for [Ni\thinspace II] than [Fe\thinspace II]. The estimated total abundances are shown in Table~\ref{tab:total_abundances}.


%the levels that give rise to [Ni\thinspace II] $\lambda 7378$ have the same multiplicity and thus the continuum pumping effects should be stronger than for [Fe\thinspace II] that depends on the metastability of the intermediate a$^4$F$_{9/2}$ level \jorge{Refrasearía un poco la frase anterior porque está algo confusa}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}


\subsection{On the anomalous [S\thinspace III] emission in HH~514}
\label{subsec:under_TS3}

There are two results for HH~514 included in Tables \ref{tab:pc} and \ref{tab:total_abundances}  that we want to highlight: both components show $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ $<$ $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])}$, and their S/H ratio is around 0.5 dex higher than the value found in the nebular gas. The abnormally large S abundance seems to rely mainly on the S$^{2+}$ one, which represents 91 per cent of the S/H ratio.

The observed trend of $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ goes in the opposite direction to the usual temperature stratification observed in H~II regions and simple photoionization models fail to reproduce the observed results \citep[][]{Binette2012}. On the other hand, the overabundance of S is much too large to be produced by errors in the assumed ICF (the abundance of S$^{2+}$ alone is higher than the total S abundance of the Orion Nebula).

In order to be certain that the enhanced S abundance is real,
it is necessary to rule out possible systematic errors in the analysis.
% A first look could make us to suspect that neither $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ nor the S$^{2+}$ abundance are real, but the product of errors in some part of our analysis of HH~514.
To that end, in the following subsections we explore some scenarios that could explain the observed results.

\subsubsection{Errors in atomic data for analyzing [S\thinspace III] lines?}
\label{subsec:atomic_data}

After analyzing different sets of transition probabilities and collision strengths of different ions, \citet{Juan-de-Dios17} conclude that the derived ionic abundances can have uncertainties of around 0.1-0.2 dex introduced by the atomic data when density is lower than $10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, but they can reach values up to 0.8 dex for higher densities. Since both components of HH~514 have extremely high densities, we expect the uncertainties due to atomic data may be amplified in these objects. Given such expectations, we decided to explore the effect of the atomic data used on the S$^{2+}$ abundance.

Instead of following the methodology of  \citet{Juan-de-Dios17} of analyzing all possible combinations of transition probabilities and collision strengths available, we first focus our attention on transition probabilities, discarding those that give clearly wrong results. If we do not do this in the first place, we may include spurious values in the resulting abundance distribution, which would increase the uncertainties associated with the atomic data. Once this first step is done, we  check the available collision strengths, analyzing their impact on $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ and the S$^{2+}$ abundance.

%\subsubsection{The transition probabilities }
%\label{subsubsec:As}

We use the observed intensity of [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 9531, 9069, 8829$ lines, arising from the common $^1$D$_2$ upper level and the [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 3722, 6312$ lines, emitted from the same $^1$S$_0$ level. Their intensity ratios depend exclusively on the transition probabilities. In Table~\ref{tab:atomic_data_test}, we compare the aforementioned [S\thinspace III] line intensity ratios observed in several positions and HH objects of the Orion Nebula and other Galactic H\thinspace II regions for which we have deep high-spectral resolution spectra with the line ratios predicted by the different atomic datasets.    

As it is well known, infrared [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 9531, 9069$ lines can be affected by telluric absorption bands \citep{Noll12}. In \citet{mendez2021} and \citet{mendez2021-2}, we mentioned that [S\thinspace III] $\lambda 9069$ was affected by telluric absorptions, while $\lambda 9531$ remained unaffected in the background emission of the Orion Nebula, while in the HHs both lines avoided the absorption bands. Since in this work we are interested in analyzing the [S\thinspace III] $\lambda$9531/$\lambda$9069 line ratio, we correct the spectra from telluric absorptions around the aforementioned lines. We use the observations of the star GD71 from each data set, normalizing them with the standard tabulated flux. Then, the science spectra were divided by the resulting telluric transmission function around [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 9531, 9069$. The corrected intensities are shown in Table~\ref{tab:tellabs}. 

[S\thinspace III] $\lambda 3722$ is usually blended with the H14 Hydrogen Balmer line. We can not simply subtract the emission of H14 using its theoretical line ratio with respect to other isolated observed H\thinspace I lines, since it is well known that H\thinspace I lines from high quantum numbers $n$ suffer deviations from case ``B'' \citep[][]{mesadelgado09, rodriguez20}. Even using  contiguous lines such as H13 or H15 may introduce important deviations \citep[see fig.~A2 of][]{rodriguez20}. Therefore, we consider that it is better to use only the observations where the spectral resolution of the data allows the correct Gaussian deblending of the lines, where the resulting FWHM of [S\thinspace III] $\lambda 3722$ is consistent with that of the isolated [S\thinspace III] $\lambda 6312$ line.

The transition probabilities tested are those available in version 1.1.13 of PyNeb and those from the CHIANTI database V10 \citep[][]{Chianti10}, named by the following acronyms: LL93-HSC95-MZ82b-KS86 \citep[][]{LL93,HSC95,MZ82b, KS86}, MZ82b-HSC95-LL93\citep[][]{MZ82b,HSC95,LL93}, FFTI06 \citep[][]{FFTI06}, TZS19\citep[][]{TZS19} and CHIANTI \citep[][]{Tayal97,FFTI06, Hudson12}. These data encompass all those studied by \citet{Juan-de-Dios17} adding  those from TZS19 and CHIANTI. The FFTI06 data file  was named as PKW09 in previous versions of PyNeb, alluding to \citet{Podobedova09}, who cited \citet{FFTI06}. 

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:atomic_data_test}, the LL93-HSC95-MZ82b-KS86 set of  transition probabilities are clearly inconsistent with observations when determining line ratios involving the [S\thinspace III] $\lambda 9531$ line from the $^1$D$_2$-$^3$P$_2$ transition, for which atomic data are taken from \citet{KS86}. This discrepancy forces us to discard   the LL93-HSC95-MZ82b-KS86 data set. With respect to the other data sets, the ones most consistent  with the observed line ratios are those by FFTI06 and CHIANTI. However, as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:A_sii}, the results obtained with the remaining data sets are not very different for the most important optical transitions ([S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 3722, 6312, 8829, 9069, 9531$). In fact, taking the mean and standard deviation of the A-values given by the datasets included in Fig.~\ref{fig:A_sii} excluding those from LL93-HSC95-MZ82b-KS86, we obtain A$_{3722}=(7.06 \pm 0.53) \times 10^{-01}$, A$_{6312}=2.20 \pm 0.08$, A$_{8829}=(6.42 \pm 1.49) \times 10^{-06}$, A$_{9069}=(2.00 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-02}$ and A$_{9531}=(5.26 \pm 0.35) \times 10^{-02}$. Of these, the one with the largest deviation is A$_{8829}$, about 23 per cent. In any case, this transition probability has very little impact in the determination of $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ and the S$^{2+}$ abundance if a line different than [S\thinspace III] $\lambda 8829$ is used, which is always the case. Moreover, if we discard the dataset of TZS19, this deviation is reduced to 4 per cent. Once the LL93-HSC95-MZ82b-KS86 data set is removed, the uncertainties associated with the transition probabilities of the optical lines seem to be around $\sim 5$ percent considering the consistency between the predictions and the observed line intensity ratios included in  Table~\ref{tab:atomic_data_test}. The previous results indicate that the available sets of transition probabilities for transitions giving rise to [S\thinspace III] lines show a high degree of consistency. From now on, we adopt the transition probabilities of FFTI06 in our calculations. This was precisely the data set we used in Paper~I and Paper~II.

%\subsubsection{The collision strengths }
%\label{subsubsec:Omegas}
Analogously to the previous procedure with transition probabilities, we also check the data sets of collision strengths available in PyNeb: GMZ95 \citep[][]{GMZ95}, TG99 \citep[][]{TG99}, HRS12 \citep[][]{HRS12}, GRHK14 \citep[][]{GRHK14} and TZS19 \citep[][]{TZS19}. These includes all the sets analyzed by \citet{Juan-de-Dios17} in addition to TZS19. The CHIANTI data base V10 adopts the same collision strengths as HRS12 by default, so does not need to be considered separately. Comparing the results for the different data sets shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:omega_siii_zoom }, we obtain the following mean collision strengths along  with their associated dispersion at 10,000 K for the most important [S\thinspace III] lines: $\Omega_{3722}=(3.65 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{-1}$, $\Omega_{6312}=1.38 \pm 0.04$, $\Omega_{8829}=(7.64 \pm 0.63)\times 10^{-1}$, $\Omega_{9069}=2.28 \pm 0.20$ and $\Omega_{9531}=4.00 \pm 0.26$. The typical dispersion is about $\sim 8$ per cent for most lines, except for [S\thinspace III] $\lambda 6312$, where the dispersion is smaller, $\sim 3$ per cent.

One way in which errors in the collision strengths could explain
the apparent low $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ and the high S$^{2+}$ abundance in the HH objects
is by changing the  $\frac{\Omega_{\text{Auroral}}}{\Omega_{\text{Nebular}}}=\frac{\Omega(3722)+\Omega(6312)}{\Omega(8829)+\Omega(9069)+\Omega(9531)}$ ratio. When $\frac{\Omega_{\text{Auroral}}}{\Omega_{\text{Nebular}}}$ decreases, $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ increases, for a fixed observed [S\thinspace III] $\frac{I(\lambda3722)+I(\lambda6312)}{I(\lambda 8829)+I(\lambda9069)+I(\lambda9531)}$ ratio. Increasing the value of the denominator in the ratio of collision strengths also decreases the derived abundance of S$^{2+}$, which is usually determined from the intensity of [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 9531, 9069$ lines. However, modifications in the values of $\Omega_{8829}, \Omega_{9069} \text{ and } \Omega_{9531}$ within a dispersion of $\sim8$ per cent are not enough to account for the discrepant values of $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ and the S$^{2+}$ abundance.

We will try to solve the aforementioned discrepancies exploring the assumption that the collision strengths of the transitions that give rise to [S\thinspace III] lines are wrong, with $\Omega_{9531}, \Omega_{9069}$ and $\Omega_{8829}$ being underestimated beyond the dispersion of $\sim8$ per cent. We will increase the values of $\Omega_{9531}, \Omega_{9069}$ and $\Omega_{8829}$, until getting $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])}=T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} $ in the jet base of HH~514. This may be considered a lower limit since it is expected that $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} $ is between $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])} $ and $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([N\thinspace II])} $ \citep[][]{Berg20}, the latter being generally higher. To achieve this, the collision strengths should be increased about 40 per cent, as we know, 5 times larger than the dispersion found comparing the available atomic data. In Table~\ref{tab:modified_data_omega} we show the $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} $ and  S$^{2+}$ abundances we obtain for each object using the transition probabilities of FFTI06, the different sets of collision strengths considered and the corresponding value of $n_{\rm e}$. In the last column, we include the results obtained increasing by a 40 per cent the $\Omega_{9531}, \Omega_{9069}$ and $\Omega_{8829}$ values of GRHK14. 

Now we discuss what other consequences the increase of 40 percent in the collision strengths may have. Using these $\Omega$ modified values, $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ matches $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])}$ in both components of HH~514\footnote{This is obviously expected for the jet base, since the increase in the collision strengths was chosen to obtain $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}= T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])}$. The result for the northern knot is independent.}, while the modification implies $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}\approx T_{\rm e} \text{ ([N\thinspace II])}$ for the Orion Nebula. The latter would imply that the S$^{2+}$ and N$^{+}$ ions coexist almost exclusively in the zone of low degree of ionization. However, the large increment we have assumed in the collision strengths are unable to give a \textit{normal}\footnote{A value consistent with that of the Orion Nebula.} S abundance in the high-velocity components. If we adopt $\text{12+log(S/H)}=7.07 \pm 0.03$ from \citet{mendez2021-2} as reference, we still have an overestimation of 0.23 dex in the jet base. A similar difference is obtained in the knot. Moreover, this experiment produces a $\text{log(S/O)} = -1.81 \pm 0.06$ for the nebular component, which is inconsistent with the solar value of $\text{log(S/O)}=-1.58 \pm 0.08$ \citep{lodders19}. Since both S and O are $\alpha$-elements, a constant abundance ratio is expected from their common nucleosynthesis. Therefore, following a \textit{reductio ad absurdum} process, we can say that large errors in the collision strengths $\Omega_{9531}$, $\Omega_{9069}$ and $\Omega_{8829}$ do not solve the observed discrepancies in  $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ and the total S abundance in HH~514.

\subsubsection{Is the [S\thinspace III] emission affected by the shock?}
\label{subsec:shock_affected}

HH objects are produced by the interaction of high-velocity flows
with the surrounding medium or by internal shocks within the flow.
In both cases, gas is initially heated and compressed in a shock front,
followed by a non-equilibrium cooling zone in which the gas returns to the
photoionization equilibrium temperature while undergoing further compression.
The cooling zone may contribute to observed CEL spectrum,
but the greatest effect is on highly ionized lines that are not typically seen
in \hii{} regions.

In both the jet and knot of HH~514 the low observed line widths of about
\SI{20}{km.s^{-1}}
(see Table~\ref{tab:sample_spectra})
imply that only low velocity internal shocks are present.
For moderate ionization lines such as [\ion{S}{3}], the relative contribution is therefore expected to be small \citep{mendez2021}.
Moreover, the emission from the cooling zone, if any, would affect $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ in the opposite direction, increasing the observed [S\thinspace III] $I(\lambda 6312)/I(\lambda 9531)$ line intensity ratio that would produce higher temperatures.   

\subsubsection{Telluric absorption bands or sky emission?}
\label{subsec:tell_abs_sky_emmision}

There are no other lines arising from  sky emission or the Orion Nebula that could be blended with [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 6312, 9069, 9531$ ($\lambda \lambda 6315.31,9073.60, 9535.87$) lines at the spectral resolution of our spectra. As commented in Sect.~\ref{subsec:atomic_data}, we correct for telluric absorptions that could affect the intensity of [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 9531, 9069$ lines in our spectra. Moreover, those [S\thinspace III] lines fall outside the absorption bands in  the spectra of HH~514. In any case, in the presence of absorption bands, their effect on [S\thinspace III] $\lambda \lambda 9531, 9069$ lines would fictitiously increase $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$ and decrease the S$^{2+}$ abundance, which is the opposite of what is found.

\subsubsection{Errors in the reddening correction?}
\label{subsec:errors_CHB}

The [S\thinspace III] $I(\lambda 6312)/I(\lambda 9531)$ line intensity ratio is highly dependent on the reddening correction. However, if we estimate what reddening coefficient is necessary in order to produce $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} \geq T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])}$, we get $\text{c}(\text{H}\beta)\geq 1.22$. This is at least 44 per cent higher than the estimated value based on the observed Balmer and Paschen H\thinspace I lines, which is simply not possible considering the quality of the flux calibration of our data. In any case, the derivation of a largely incorrect $\text{c}(\text{H}\beta)$ value would produce many different and noticeable inconsistencies in our results that are obviously not observed. 

\subsubsection{Is the density  overestimated?}
\label{subsec:ov_density}

Let us suppose that the representative density of the [S\thinspace III] zone is overestimated and its true value is more similar to that of the Orion Nebula. As can be seen in panel (a) of Fig.~\ref{fig:plasma}, this would imply that in the jet base, $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} \approx 10200 \text{ K}$ if $n_{\rm e} \leq 10000 \text{ cm}^{-3}$. However, even assuming that value of $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$, the S$^{2+}$ abundance would be still overestimated. A $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} \approx 13000 \text{ K}$ would be necessary to obtain a {\it normal} S$^{2+}$ abundance, which can not be achieved with any density value.

\subsection{Comparison between HH~514 and its associated proplyd}
\label{subsec:proplyd}

In the previous section, we established that none of the potential systematic biases
can plausibly cause the observed \siii{} emission from the HH~514 jet,
leaving an enhanced sulfur abundance as the most likely explanation.
Given that the ionized base of the jet emerges from the ionization front
of the proplyd 170-337 \citep{bally00},
it is important to compare the abundances in the two components.
% \citet{bally00} identified the origin of the entrained material of HH~514 in an outflow from proplyd 170-337. A plausible hypothesis could be that the photoionized material in the outskirts of 170-337 is sulphur-rich and during the ejection that gave rise to HH~514 that material did not get well mixed with the surrounding gas.

In our UVES observations, 170-337 is within Cut~1. We interpolate the nebular emission above and below the zone covered by 170-337 along the slit, so that we can separate the proplyd emission from that of the Orion Nebula.
The line intensities used are shown in Table~\ref{tab:fluxes_proplyd}.
The complete study of 170-337 will be analyzed in a future paper (M\'endez-Delgado et al., in prep).
By analyzing the spectrum, we obtain  $n_{\rm e}\approx 10^{5.85 \pm 0.20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ from the $n_{\rm e}$([S\thinspace II]) $\lambda$4069/$\lambda$4076 diagnostic (no [Fe\thinspace III] emission lines are detected in 170-337). We use those [S\thinspace II] lines -- that originate from the upper levels \chem{^2P} -- because of their very high critical densities, above the $n_{\rm e}$ value obtained for the proplyd.
This density is close to the value of \SI{1.3e6}{cm^{-3}}
found by \citet{henney99} for the same proplyd
from modelling the H\(\alpha\) surface brightness profile. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:density_map} we show the 2-D density map obtained with MEGARA from the [S\thinspace II] $\lambda$6731/$\lambda$6716 ratio. Lines that come from the intermediate \chem{^2D} levels of \chem{S^{+}} and have a considerable lower critical density. In Fig.~\ref{fig:density_map}, we can see that 170-337 shows a rather low contrast with respect to the surroundings, because the emission of [S\thinspace II] $\lambda\lambda$6731, 6716 lines is dominated by the background much lower-density nebular emission. High-density clumps as the proplyd 170-337 can contribute appreciably to the emission of lines arising from the higher levels --as the $T_{\rm e}$-sensitive auroral lines--, which are less affected by collisional deexcitation. The use of incorrect density diagnostics can lead to wrong estimates of physical conditions and chemical abundances \citep[][]{mendez2021-2}. 
%The density of 170-337 contrast with Fig.~\ref{fig:density_map}, where the nebular background has not been subtracted to derive $n_{\rm e}$ with the [S\thinspace II] $\lambda$6731/$\lambda$6716 diagnostic. An object as dense as 170-337 has a high rate of collisional de-excitation in the  $^2D$ levels of S$^{+}$, and therefore the [S\thinspace II] emission occurs largely through $\lambda \lambda 4069, 4076$ lines, originated in the higher levels $^2P$. This reinforces that, depending on the physical position within the line of sight and its optical depth, a high-density clump --as 170-337-- can go unnoticed through the [S\thinspace II] $\lambda$6731/$\lambda$6716 ratio, dominated in this case by the nebular emission. 


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{density_map.pdf}
\caption{Density map obtained with the intensity ratio [S\thinspace II] $\lambda$6731/$\lambda$6716 using the MEGARA-IFU observations (see Fig.~\ref{fig:megara}). This map reveals in a partial way only, the density structures present in the Field of View (see text).}
\label{fig:density_map}
\end{figure}


By adopting the correct density for the ionized layers of 170-337, we obtain $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])} \approx T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} \approx T_{\rm e} \text{ ([N\thinspace II])} \approx 8000 \pm 1000 \text{ K}$, in total consistency with the expected values for the gas in photoionization equilibrium within the radiation field of the Orion Trapezium. Although the uncertainties associated with the three temperature diagnostics are high, due to the extremely large density of the proplyd, the convergence of the diagnostics ensures the reliability of the derived physical conditions, yielding the adopted temperature $T_{\rm e}=\SI{8010 \pm 60}{K}$. With the aforementioned physical conditions we obtain $\text{12+log(S/H)} \approx 7.10 \pm 0.04 $ which is consistent with the value derived by \citet{mendez2021-2} for HH~204, representative of the chemical composition of the Orion Nebula. Therefore, the photoionized material of the outer layers of proplyd 170-337 does not show an overabundance of S.


%\jorge{Given that this diagnostic provided a relatively uncertain density in HH514 I and II, it would be interesting to include some words justifying its use in this case (against the use of the [Fe III] diagnostic)} \eduardo{es que no se ven lineas de FeIII en 170-337.}\jorge{Lo suponía, pero no hay que suponer que el lector sea adivino :P. Otra cosa es que el diagnóstico de S II parece bastante incierto en las dos componentes del HH, por lo que asumo que es también el caso en el proplyd. ¿Cómo afectaría esto a la dteerminación de abundancia?}, 

\subsection{Implications of the elevated S abundance in HH~514}
\label{sec:why-do-two}
% \subsubsection{The overabundance of S in HH~514 as indirect evidence of planetary formation within the Orion Nebula?}
\label{subsec:real_overabundance}

From section~\ref{subsec:under_TS3}, we have ruled out several scenarios that may produce an unrealistic overabundance of S and a low $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$. Therefore, it is possible to affirm that the overabundance of S/H in HH~514 is real.
Furthermore, neither the surrounding nebula nor the proplyd photoevaporation flow
show the same overabundance.
The other significant difference between the gas phase abundances in the
two flows is the approximately solar Fe and Ni abundance in HH~514,
compared with severely depleted abundances in the proplyd (similar to the nebula).
This is most simply explained by dust destruction in the HH object,
which liberates Fe and Ni to the gas phase, while it remains locked within grains in the case of the proplyd.
It is therefore reasonable to suppose that the difference in S abundances
may also be related to processes involving dust grains.

No binary companion to the central star of 170-337 has been detected,
either spectroscopically \citep{Tobin:2009a}
or visually \citep{Duchene:2018a}.
Therefore, it is likely that
both the proplyd and HH flows originate from the same protostellar disk,
the flows must be launched from different radii.
In the case of the proplyd, an initially neutral photoevaporation flow
is driven by FUV radiation from the portion of the disk surface where
the sound speed in the FUV-heated gas (\SI{\approx 3}{km.s^{-1}})
exceeds the local gravitational escape velocity,
\citep{Johnstone:1998a}.
For a stellar mass of \SI{0.3}{\msun},
this implies radii greater than about \SI{30}{AU}
and up to the outer radius of the disk,
which must lie between \SI{44}{AU}
(size of CO emission, \citealp{Boyden:2020a})
and \SI{90}{AU}
(radius of ionization front, \citealp{Henney:1998b}).
In the case of the jet, ...


Although Fe and Ni abundances may be higher in photoionized HHs  due to destruction of dust grains \citep[][]{Blagrave06, mesadelgado09, mendez2021, mendez2021-2}, the S overabundance in HH~514, would imply that the dust destroyed by the shock front had a large fraction of depleted S. This is an anomalous behaviour in photoionized nebulae, where S is usually assumed to be entirely in the gas phase, although neutral ISM shows some indications of S depletion \citep[][]{Jenkins09}.

%Understanding the overabundance of S in HH~514 may be important to mapping out the pathway connecting the gaseous S from the ISM of the star forming regions and the rocky S compounds found in our planet. 
It is well known that planetary formation process is capable of build up large grains in protoplanetary disks \citep[][]{Beckwith2000}. Recently, \citet{Kama19} have suggested the formation of large sulfide mineral reservoirs during the accretion process from the protoplanetary disk to a central star above 1.4 solar masses. The presence of a giant planet immersed in the disk, can cause a pressure bump that can accumulate the largest dust particles \citep{Pinilla2012,Birnstiel16}, among which would be the sulfides, whereas the smaller dust grains and gas can freely flow towards the star \citep[][]{Kama19}.

In the hypothetical case of an interaction of HH~514 with a planet-forming disk, the filtered dust grains would be destroyed after the passage of the shock front, releasing the S and the other dust compounds into the gaseous phase. The increase of heavy-element atoms in this small area would stimulate the gas cooling through the emission of CELs. This would be particularly important for $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$, since the increase in the abundance of S/H would make this area to have an important weight in the integrated conditions along the line of sight. Other diagnostics such as $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])}$ can mask the effect since the O abundance would not be importantly affected in the dust destruction zone, since this element forms more volatile compounds. 
%The confirmation of planet-forming disks in the surrounding environment of HH~514 would be an important discovery. 
As shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:cuts} and \ref{fig:megara}, the position of 
the jet base component of HH~514 coincides with 170-337 and, therefore, the S-rich material should come from a shadowed area inside this proplyd. As the same abundance pattern is also seen in the knot, the origin of the material of this last object should be the same. Another scenario that could explain the overabundance of S in HH~514 is the existence of some sort of S-rich pre-stellar cores not related to planetary formation, which would break up during the propagation of the HHs that these objects form.  

%as mentioned in Sec.~\ref{subsec:proplyd}, or S-reservoirs from any of the other nearby proplyds within the flow direction of HH~514. For the latter scenario to take place, a protoplanetary disk should exist behind 170-337 along the line of sight, since HH~514 propagates at an angle of $\sim -72 ^\circ$  with respect to the plane of the sky, in the opposite direction to the observer. 

The aforementioned scenarios merit further investigation. However, regardless of the phenomenon that produce the S-rich clumps, the existence of HHs and gas jets capable of breaking them up ensures the existence of local metallicity variations in the gas phase of star-forming regions, which may be sources of internal temperature fluctuations, as proposed by \citet{Peimbert67}. However, in this particular case, the global impact of these fluctuations in the surroundings of HH~514 seems to be rather small.


%Given the blister 3D geometry of the Orion Nebula, it is possible that the number of protoplanetary disks is even larger, being immersed within the line of sight, towards the propagation direction of HH~514. 
%They will be explored in future papers of this series



%In the previous subsections we have ruled out several scenarios that may produce an unrealistic overabundance of S (and a low $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$), it seems reasonable to affirm that the abundance of S/H in HH~514 is higher than in the Orion Nebula. However, the physical phenomenon that is causing this overabundance of S is not clear. It has to be related to the interaction of HH~514 and the surrounding environment, since we have seen that in the source of HH~514, the proplyd 170-337, the abundance of S is consistent with the rest of the Nebula. %Additionally, the S must have a special role in the phenomenon of interaction between HH~514 and the surrounding environment.

%In planet-forming disks, the main sulphur reservoirs are not well known. Although the S is mostly in gaseous phase in the ISM, most of it is found in rocks in the solar system. The path from the ISM to the planet-forming disks is not well understood \citep[][]{Kama19}. Recently, \citet{Kama19} have suggested the existence of S in refractory dust or sulfide mineral reservoirs. These dust grains are relatively large. In a star-protoplanetary disk system, some of the material in the disk is accreted towards the star. However, the presence of an object, such as a planet immersed in the disk, can cause a pressure bump that can accumulate the largest dust particles \citep{Pinilla2012,Birnstiel16}, filtering them from the smaller dust grains and gas that can freely flow towards the star \citep[][]{Kama19}.

%It is possible to recreate this scenario in the observed area of this work. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hst}, in addition to 170-337, there are several proplyds and stellar objects surrounded by protoplanetary disks. If HH~514 pass through a protoplanetary disk where the S is accumulated in reservoirs of large dust grains, the shock could break them up, releasing the S into its gaseous phase. This process would increase the relative abundance of S/H, cooling down the gas through the emission of [S\thinspace III] CELs, reflected in a lower $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])}$. Since HH~514 propagates radially in the opposite direction to the observer, it is possible that this process only affects a relatively small area along the integrated line of sight, which would imply that the obtained overabundance of S is a lower limit to the real abundance in the zone where the dust reservoirs of S have been destroyed. This would also imply that the drop in temperature in this small zone would not be reflected in other ions, whose elements do not form dust grains or do so in more volatile compounds such as O, consistent with our determination of $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])}$ in HH~514.


\subsection{The total abundances of Fe and Ni}
\label{subsec:totalFeandNi}

In the jet base component of HH~514 we are able to derive the abundances of Ni$^{+}$, Ni$^{2+}$, Fe$^{+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$. As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:ionic_total_abundances}, despite of only having an upper limit to the abundance of Fe$^{3+}$, the ICF schemes of \citet{rodriguez05} indicate that the total abundance of Fe/H should be close to the sum of the abundances of Fe$^{+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ and the upper limit of Fe$^{3+}$. Both the total abundances of Ni and Fe in the jet base are a factor 34 higher than in the main emission from the Orion Nebula. Moreover, these values are very close to the reference Solar values from \citet{lodders19}. However, this does not necessarily mean that all the dust grains containing Fe and Ni have been destroyed by the shock. This is also supported by the evidence of thermal dust IR emission from HH~514 \citep{smith05}, which suggests the survival of some amount of dust in the object. In connection with Sec.~\ref{subsec:real_overabundance}, the passage of the shock front associated with HH~514 is able to destroy the dust reservoirs of S in a planet-forming disk. However, HH~514 can also destroy dust grains of zones of the Orion Nebula outside the S  reservoirs, with normal S abundance. To estimate the fraction of Fe released from each kind of dust grains, we can assume that the S excess is produced by the destruction of FeS compounds, as suggested by \citet{Kama19}. In addition, NiS compounds should be present as well. For each atom of S released, one atom of Fe or Ni should be released too. Since the S excess will be equal to the difference between the S abundance in HH~514 and the representative value of the Orion Nebula, then:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{n(\text{S})_{\text{excess}}}{n(\text{H})}\approx\frac{n(\text{Fe+Ni})_{\text{excess}}}{n(\text{H})}\approx\frac{1.05\times n(\text{Fe})_{\text{excess}}}{n(\text{H})}=1.52\times 10^{-5},
\end{equation*}
adopting $\text{12+log(S/H)}=7.07 \pm 0.03$ \citep{mendez2021-2} for the Orion Nebula. Considering the Fe and Ni abundances obtained in the nebular components, this would imply that of the total abundances of Fe/H and Ni/H in the jet base, $\sim$67 per cent would come from dust destruction of S reservoirs, $\sim$30 per cent from the destruction of dust grains of normal S abundance and $\sim$3 per cent from Fe and Ni that were already in the gaseous phase. %HH~514 destroys dust grains in a larger proportion than  HH~202~S, HH~529~II, HH~529~III and HH~204 \citep[][]{mesadelgado09,mendez2021,mendez2021-2}, due to its higher velocity.




 



%This suggests that in HH~514~I all the dust grains with content of Fe and Ni could have been destroyed by the shock, releasing their content to the gaseous phase. This would allow, by the first time, to have a direct estimate of the total abundance of these elements without corrections for dust depletion. However, in connection with Sec.~\ref{subsec:real_overabundance}, if the scenario discussed is the one that is taking place and if the dust reservoirs of S are dominated by FeS or NiS, then the derived abundances of Fe or Ni may not be representative of the gas of the Orion Nebula. However, if the S reservoirs are dominated by other sulfides, the abundances of Fe or Ni would remain unaltered, being representative of the Orion Nebula.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary_and_conclusions}
We analyze the physical conditions and chemical abundances of the photoionized Herbig-Haro object HH~514 and the Orion Nebula making use of high-spectral resolution spectra taken with UVES at VLT, high-spatial resolution imaging from the HST and deep MEGARA-IFU spectra.  
Due to the Doppler shift between the emission of the Orion Nebula and HH~514, we independently study the emission of two high-velocity components: the jet base and a knot. These HHs are extremely dense: $n_{\rm e}(\text{HH~514~jet base})=10^{5.37} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ and $n_{\rm e}(\text{HH~514~knot})=10^{4.87} \text{ cm}^{-3}$. However, they present temperatures consistent with  photoionization equilibrium in the Orion Nebula, $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])} \sim 9000\text{ K}$.

The total abundances of the high-velocity components are fully consistent with the ones derived in the Orion Nebula with the exception of S, Fe, and Ni. In the case of S, the S$^{2+}$ ion comprises 91 per cent of the total abundance. Furthermore, we found that $T_{\rm e} \text{ ([S\thinspace III])} < T_{\rm e} \text{ ([O\thinspace III])} $, which is difficult to explain under normal photoionization conditions \citep[][]{Binette2012}. We rule out the possibility that the S overabundance may be spuriously originated from errors in the atomic data or in the observations;  it is most probably produced by the destruction of S-rich dust in the shock front of HH~514. The origin of  S-rich dust reservoirs maybe related to the process that \citet{Kama19} propose to occur in protoplanetary discs, which consists on the accumulation of large sulfide dust grains around giant planets during  accretion from the disc to the central star. The spatial coincidence of the jet base with proplyd 170-337 indicates that this last object is the most probable source of the S-rich gas entrained in HH~514. In the jet base we obtain log(Fe/H)+12$ =  7.33 \pm 0.02$ and log(Ni/H)+12$ = 6.03 \pm 0.08$. These abundances are a factor 34 higher than those derived in the Orion Nebula and are very close to the Solar values \citep[][]{lodders19}. We estimate that $\sim$67 per cent of the total Fe/H and Ni/H abundances in the jet base have origin in the destruction of sulfide reservoirs, whereas $\sim$30 per cent would come from the destruction of dust grains with a poorer S content, having just $\sim$3 per cent from Fe and Ni previously present in the gaseous phase. HH~514 destroys dust grains of the Orion Nebula gas more efficiently than other HHs studied in the literature such as HH~202~S, HH~529~II, HH~529~III and HH~204 \citep[][]{mesadelgado09, mendez2021, mendez2021-2}. %\jorge{OJO!!!
